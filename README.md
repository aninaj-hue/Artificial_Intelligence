Let's suppose that two friends live in different cities on a map. At every step, we can
simultaneously move each friend to a neighboring city on the map. Time required to pass
from city i to the neighboring city j is equal to the length of the road d(i, j) between the 2 cities, but at
every step the friend who arrives first has to wait until the other friend arrives
(and calls the first one on his cell phone) before the next shift can start. WANT
for the two friends to meet as soon as possible.
